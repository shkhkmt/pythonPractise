# Comments start with a pound sign. Content after the sign is deleted.

print("You can do whatever you like on a line and then comment after it like so.") # and whatever comes after the pound wont figure in the code.

# Remember that you can use this to comment out code if a module isn't working or you want to exclude a line of code.

print(22/7) #this will still print pi.
